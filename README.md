Fiber HOPtics is fully coded in Python 3 using Pygame modules.


We created this project at a 24-hour hackathon as a way to help fundraise money for network improvements on our university's campus.

Controls: "Spacebar" for jumping, "Enter" to restart the game.

Known Issue(s): Restarting the game opens a brand new pygame window
